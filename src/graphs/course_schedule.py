LeetCode 207: Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses -
1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that
you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take
  course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation:
There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation:
There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also
have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:
- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

class Solution:

        Check whether all courses can be finished.

        Args:
            numCourses: int - number of courses, labeled 0 to numCourses - 1
            prerequisites: List[List[int]] - prerequisites[i] = [a, b] means course b must be taken before course a

        Returns:
